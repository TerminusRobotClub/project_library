# project_library
This is the project collection from members of Terminus robot club, started from 2025.
Our aim is to create a platform for students to share ideas and build an academic community based on the school.
Here we can share our ideas and build a library to provide insights and evoke ideas for next generations.
Every contributors name and year of graduation would be recorded, thank you all!
